Build a responsive sublease listing web app for Notre Dame students using React with the following features:

1. Layout & Navigation:
	•	Standard homepage with a top navigation bar (login, sign up, home).
	•	Left-side filter panel.
	•	Right-side map using Google Maps API to show property pins by user-submitted location (latitude/longitude).
	•	A scrollable list of listing cards below or beside the map, depending on screen size.

2. Listing Card Display:
	•	Each card displays:
	•	Cover image (require at least one image on submission).
	•	Price per month (e.g., $1200/month).
	•	Bedrooms and bathrooms with emojis (e.g., 🛏️ 3BR · 🛁 2BA).
	•	Address + distance to campus (e.g., 789 Eddy Street · 0.8 miles from campus).
	•	Availability window (e.g., Available March–August 2025).
	•	Amenities tags (e.g., WiFi, Parking, AC, Laundry).

3. Filters:
	•	Sidebar filter for:
	•	Price range
	•	Distance to campus
	•	Furnished (yes/no)
	•	Bedrooms / Bathrooms
	•	Amenities (checkbox: WiFi, Parking, AC, Laundry, Dishwasher, etc.)

4. Authentication:
	•	Use Firebase Auth.
	•	Only allow users with @nd.edu emails to register, log in, and post.
	•	Display listings to the public, but restrict listing uploads/edits to signed-in ND students.

5. Posting a Listing:
	•	Allow authenticated users to:
	•	Upload cover image and optional extra photos
	•	Enter listing info (title, price, address, dates available, contact email/phone)
	•	Choose amenities and enter property description
	•	Mark listing as “No longer available”
	•	Store data in Firebase Firestore.

6. Listing Detail Modal:
	•	When a user clicks a card, open a modal or panel view with:
	•	Larger image
	•	Full details
	•	Contact section (email, phone)
	•	Contact form (name, email, message input with “Send Message” button)

7. Design Notes:
	•	Use TailwindCSS or similar for styling.
	•	Include emojis for visual clarity (🛏️, 🛁, 🧺, 🛜, 🚗).
	•	Responsive design: for mobile, display map and listings stacked.
	•	Optional: add email trigger (EmailJS or Firebase Functions) for contact form.

Use React for the frontend, Firebase for auth + database, and Google Maps JavaScript API for geographic view. The goal is to make the platform searchable, ND-student exclusive for posting, and intuitive for users looking for subleases.
